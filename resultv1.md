| **Memory Pool Utilization** | <1% | Efficient memory management |
| **Cache Stalls** | Minimal | Successful overlap of communication/computation |

### Latency Breakdown Analysis

**First Inference (Cold Start):**
- Embedding layer: 5,006.7ms (cache miss)
- Subsequent layers: ~2ms each (successful prefetch)
- Total: 5,042.2ms

**Warmed-up Inference:**
- Embedding layer: ~1.5ms (cache hit)
- Computation layers: ~2-3ms each
- Total: ~25ms

The results demonstrate that XL-Share's **intelligent prefetching effectively hides CXL access latency** after the initial warm-up period.
